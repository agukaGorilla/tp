<br>

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer.<br>
    * Full guide for installation [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html). If you are familiar with the process, you can download Java directly [here](https://www.oracle.com/asean/java/technologies/downloads/).<br>
      **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).<br><br>


2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/releases).
   * The folder containing the downloaded `GymContactsPro.jar` is your _home folder_ for GymContactsPro.
   * For the best experience, move the `GymContactsPro.jar` file to a dedicated and easily accessible folder, such as: <br>
   **Windows:** `Documents\GymContactsPro` <br>
   **macOS:** `~/Documents/GymContactsPro` <br>
   **Linux:** `~/Documents/GymContactsPro` 
   <br><br>

3. On your respective Operating System (OS), open a terminal to launch GymContactsPro.

   <tabs>
      <tab header="Windows">

   Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:

      ```bash
      cd PATH_TO_HOME_FOLDER
      java -jar GymContactsPro.jar
      ```

      <box type="info" seamless>

   PATH_TO_HOME_FOLDER is the path to the folder where you placed the `GymContactsPro.jar` file in. If your _home folder_
   was your `Downloads\GymContactsPro` folder, the command would be `cd C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\Downloads\GymContactsPro`

      </box>

      </tab>
      <tab header="Mac">

   Open **Terminal** and run:

      ```bash
      cd PATH_TO_HOME_FOLDER
      java -jar GymContactsPro.jar
      ```

      <box type="info" seamless>

   PATH_TO_HOME_FOLDER is the path to the folder where you placed the `GymContactsPro.jar` file in. If your _home folder_
   was your `Downloads/GymContactsPro` folder, the command would be `cd ~/Downloads/GymContactsPro`

      </box>

      </tab>
      <tab header="Linux">

   Open **Terminal** and run:

      ```bash
      cd PATH_TO_HOME_FOLDER
      java -jar GymContactsPro.jar
      ```

      <box type="info" seamless>

   PATH_TO_HOME_FOLDER is the path to the folder where you placed the `GymContactsPro.jar` file in. If your _home folder_
   was your `Downloads/GymContactsPro` folder, the command would be `cd ~/Downloads/GymContactsPro`

      </box>

      </tab>
   </tabs>

   An interface shown below should appear in a few seconds. The app comes preloaded with some sample data.<br><br>

## Features

### Before We Begin . . .
<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes here apply to all features introduced below (unless otherwise specified)**
<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the fields whose values are to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a field which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [p/PHONE]` can be used as `n/John Doe p/92214584` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Fields can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Commands can be typed in any capitalization.<br>
  e.g. `sort n/desc` and `SORT N/DESC` are acceptable.

* Fields can be typed in any capitalization and will be shown as it is.<br>
  e.g. `add n/MASON ...` will save the new member with the capitalized name `MASON`

* Extraneous characters for commands that do not take in fields (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Rules for the fields are:
  * `MEMBERSHIP_ID`: Must be a 4-digit number from `1000` to `9999`
  * `NAME`: Must be non-empty.
  * `PHONE`: Must be exactly 8 digits long and start with 8 or 9.
  * `EMAIL`: Must be a properly formatted email address (e.g. `johndoe@example.com`).
  * `ADDRESS`: Must end with a valid 6-digit postal code.
  * `EXPIRY_DATE`: Must be a valid date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` and, cannot be before the current date.
<br><br>
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:**
* When finding by name `n/`, you can use either the first or last name as keywords. 
  * For example, if the member's name is `Bernice Yu`, searching for `n/Bernice` will find `Bernice Yu`. Similarly, searching for `n/Yu` will also find `Bernice Yu`.

  (unless `sort none` is used to disable sorting to return to default order ordering – ascending Membership ID).
  * Order can be either `asc` or `desc` to sort members in ascending or descending order respectively. <br><br>
* Sorting order, regardless of whether it is `asc` or `desc`, will be "turned on" and
  applied on displayed lists across all commands unless "turned off" by `sort none`<br><br>
* When multiple members have the same value for the chosen sorting field (e.g. two members with the name `Alice`), their Membership ID will be used as a secondary sorting criterion.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:**
* Sort by `sort m/asc` to find out which members have to renew their memberships soon.

</box>

**Example input:**
```

    * If the membership is still valid, the new expiry date is calculated from the current expiry date.
<br><br>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the new computer, then move the `data` folder from the home folder of `GymContactsPro.jar` on your previous computer to the home folder of `GymContactsPro.jar` on the new computer.

**Q**: What happens if the application freezes or is forcibly closed?<br>
**A**: If the application freezes (but is not forcefully closed), all your previous changes are safely saved. However, if the application is forcibly closed while saving data (e.g., force quit, system crash, power loss), the data file may become corrupted. In such cases, the application will start with empty member data on the next run. To prevent data loss, it is recommended to regularly back up your `addressbook.json` file.

**Q**: Why am I getting a permission error when trying to run the app on Linux?<br>
**A**: If you get a permission error, you should make the file executable. Try typing in the terminal: `chmod +x GymContactsPro.jar`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
   * The `preferences.json` file is located in the home folder of `GymContactsPro.jar`
